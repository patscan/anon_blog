psuedo code for anon blog

two core models; posts and tags

suggested that we make 3 controller files:
index.rb
posts.rb
tags.rb;

index controller: 
just have index route; displaying homepage

tags controller
Tag related routes

posts controller
Post related routes

Methods we want for posts: (form method in parens:route idea)
1. show me all posts (get : post/all ?)
2. show me a particular post (get : post/:id )
3. create a new post ( post : post/create )
4. edit an existing post ( put : post/:id/edit )
5. delete an existing post ( delete : post/:id/delete )

Methods we want for tags:
1. Show all posts given a tag  (get : tag/:tag_name )

Tags are create via the Post creation form; (possibly on edit)

Create all necessary models and migrations; you should have three models what are they?

Post
Tag
posts_and_tags   (it's many to many, right? a post can have many tags; 
                  a tag can belong to many posts; we need a join table to
                  express this relationship; remember, we don't need a primary
                  id on this table )

we need to ensure posts have titles, and have body copy, like so;

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :body, :presence => true
  validates :title, :presence => true
end

but we also need to do it on the database level; so insert the same logic on the validations; <----!!!!!!!!

design simple pages and forms; here's an idea to allow multiple tags to get entered
<label for="post_tags">Tags:</label>
<input id="post_tags" name="post[tags]" value="tag1, tag2, some other tag, a fourth tag">

Handle error cases;
handle Style!
